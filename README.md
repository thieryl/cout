# AWS Complete Environment using Terraform

![Diagram](images/AWS_diagram.jpg)

This AWS environment built using the Terraform automation. We will create everything you need from scratch: VPC, subnets, routes, security groups, an EC2 machine with MySQL installed inside a private network, and a webapp machine with Apache and its PHP module in a public subnet. The webapp machine reads a table in the database and shows the result.
